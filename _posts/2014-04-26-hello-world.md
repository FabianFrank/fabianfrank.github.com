I have created this blog to have a random space on the web, where I can share
anyting that doesn't fit into a tweet. I'm trying to spend as little time as
possible on the infrastructure of this blog and as much time possible on cool
projects and writing posts.
  
If you want to know who I am, you can check out my [about page](/about.html).
